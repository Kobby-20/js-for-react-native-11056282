# Java for React Native - [11056282]

Welcome to the Java for React Native course repository, tailored specifically for [11056282]. In this repository, you will find the code for several tasks that involve JavaScript programming.

## Task 1: arrayManipulation.js

In the arrayManipulation.js file, you will find the implementation of the processArray function. This function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2: formatArrayStrings

Within the arrayManipulation.js file, you will also find the formatArrayStrings function. This function takes two arrays as arguments - an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number. If the number is even, the string is capitalized, and if the number is odd, the string is converted to lowercase.

## Task 3: userInfo.js

The userInfo.js file contains the implementation of the createUserProfiles function. This function takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing the originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).
